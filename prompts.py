mixtape_prompt = """Come up with 10 fictitious bands and songs for a 1990s cassette mixtape with the theme: "{theme}"

For the mixtape, provide the following information:
- Mixtape backstory (e.g. "This was a romantic tape made by Neil to Laura, a girl he liked", or "This was a collecting of local underground punk bands", always in third person)
- Mixtape title (e.g. "From Neil to Laura", or "Underground Buzz")
- Mixtape homemade cover illustration prompt, including the title to go on the cover, examples:
"Mixtape cassette cover, pencil drawing on top of photograph of a man in a suit, drawn across him. Writing: "Lamehouse", written with old uneven typewriter, ink blotches. DIY aesthetic. 1990s feel."
"Mixtape cassette cover, colored pencil drawing of a lighthouse, handdrawn, amateur. Writing: "To Jane", shaky lettering. DIY aesthetic. 1990s romantic feel."
"Mixtape cassette cover, pen scribbles, all hand drawn, chaotic, dirty and unbalanced. Writing: "NEW HARDCORE" in black felt tip, bad uneven lettering. DIY aesthetic. 1990s punk feel."
"Mixtape cassette cover, magazine collage + hand drawn details. Writing: "NIGHT OUT" in black felt tip, uneven handwriting. DIY aesthetic. 1990s feel."
"Crudely Hand drawn cover for a homemade mixtape, from Charlie to Lily. Drawn with colored pencils. Viewed straight on."
You can use paper clippings, collages, photos, drawings, etc -- all kinds of handmade things
The illustation prompt must specify that things are handmade, uneven, and so on, so we get that natural look and feel.

For each song, provide the following information:
- Band name (e.g. "The Funky Monkeys")
- Song name (e.g. "The Cage After Dark")
- Lyrics description ("Silly lyrics about animals having fun at the zoo after closing hours.")
- Music genre (e.g. "90s alternative rock, loud quiet loud style" - must always start with 90s, as that is the appropriate era, and you should use genres that existed at this time)
- Vocals style (e.g. "female")
- Is it an ensemble (e.g. a boy band or a girl group with multiple singers)

For band names, make sure you apply a variety of different naming schemes - single word, The "something", the singer's name, two words, a question, or other variations. Make sure you vary names and number of words in the names.
For song names, make sure they are varied and don't just restate the theme of the mixtape, but are about many different things ‚Äî some cryptic, some abstract, some straightforward. Use a wide range of naming styles, such as: Single-word titles, Phrases or sentences, Cryptic or symbolic names, Questions, Character names, Verb-driven or action-based titles, Found objects or nostalgic ephemera, Strange or playful names, Contradictions or juxtapositions, Places and time-based titles
Avoid naming every song after the mixtape's title or theme. Let the songs tell their own stories, even if they're only loosely connected by vibe.

The song is called: {song_name}
The music genre is: {music_genre}
The vocals style is: {vocals_style}

Guidance for the lyrics: {lyrics_description}

Remember, your goal is not state the theme or guidance directly in the lyrics, but let it inspire you.

You should NOT yet write the lyrics, instead consider the following:

1. What is the song about? Remember, the song's theme doesn't have to be the same as the mixtape's theme - it just needs to fit on a mixtape with that theme.
2. What is the viewpoint of the song?
3. What are some specifics you want to lean into in the lyrics? How do you avoid it being too on the nose? Make sure you show, don't tell.
4. Some songs are very personal and mention people and places by names. Is this such a song? If so, who and what does it mention?
5. What should the tone and attitude be?
6. What sets it apart from other songs and makes it interesting or unique?
7. Consider what kind of lyrics and writing style is usually applied in this musical genre
8. What kind of language should you use? Direct, romantic, with or without metaphors, etc. Is it complex or simplistic?
